ðŸ’¡ Why This Project?

Basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations form the foundation of nearly every web application. Whether you're building a blog, an e-commerce site, a user management system, or an admin panel â€” at the core, you need functionality to manage data.

This project demonstrates how to implement robust and secure CRUD APIs using Express.js with MySQL, following best practices like:

JWT-based authentication

Input validation

Password encryption

Modular structure using Sequelize ORM

It serves as a solid boilerplate for most Express-based backend applications.

# Express MySQL CRUD API with JWT Authentication

A secure and scalable RESTful API built with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MySQL**, and **Sequelize ORM**.  
Supports user registration, login with JWT authentication, and full CRUD operations on user data.

## Getting Started

### Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rajdeveloper32/node-express-mysql-crud.git
cd node-express-mysql-crud

Install dependencies

npm install

---

Setup environment variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following:

PORT=3000
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=your_mysql_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
DB_NAME=your_database_name
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key

---

Initialize the database
Make sure your MySQL server is running and the database specified in .env exists.
You can create the database manually if it doesnâ€™t exist:

CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;

npm run dev
The server will start on the port specified in .env (default: 3000).

Usage Example

Register a User

POST /api/auth/register
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "firstname": "John",
  "lastname": "Doe",
  "username": "johndoe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "password123",
  "confirmPassword": "password123"
}

---
Login a User

POST /api/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}

---

Access Protected Routes
Include the JWT token in the Authorization header:

Authorization: Bearer <your_token_here>

---

I have also added the Postman collection. You can download and import it into Postman to test the APIs directly from there.
